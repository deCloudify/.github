# Welcome to  deCloudify 

Community for development of projects in order to envision the future of web3 native and scalable cloud. 

We take inspiration from the projects that are building new primitives on top of decentralised compute, storage and network protocols and infrastructure, and combining them with the research of the already developed  in the web3 projects (Filecoin, Protocol labs, Akash network, stackOS , etc) and building frameworks to scale their implementation.




## how its developed: 

We are currently mapping the current services available in the decentralised compute space (on the runtime, storage and networking) and then taking from the benefits like [cloud native projects landscape](https://github.com/cncf/glossary) and combining them with the already build projects, or to incubate new projects that build on top of the decentralised tech stack tools the work across the  aspects of access control, networking, resources provisionment, etc. 




## links to the prominent projects: 

- [Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/guide#introduction): This correponds to mapping all of the projects in the vertical of cloud computing and their statistics.


## About the team. 

 The initiative is started by [Dhruv Malik](Github:@dhruvmalik007) having passion in doing research across the verticals in the web3 space in terms of application architect and as smart contract developer.
