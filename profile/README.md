# Welcome to  deCloudify :cloud: :chains: 

Community for development of projects in order to envision the future of web3 native and scalable cloud native applications.  


## About: 

We are currently mapping the current services available in the decentralised web3 space (on the runtime, storage, networking) and bundling them into single fullstack framework, with following components: 

- Unified authentication framework: allowing users to create custom authentication workflows from using their custom web2 authentication workflows (oauth, OIDC, digital KYC platforms) to import them onto web3 based identities (DID, zk attestations ) along with authentication workflows (SIWE kinda for every major available EVM/non EVM chains).

- support for every major blockchain runtime: 
   - creating your basic well setup template to deploy EVM/non EVM generated template will be generated  `yarn generate <blockchain-name>`.

- setting up your backend infrasturcture as Code (with the web3 based development kit) with native support to GraphQL services like Hausra for fast indexing of data.

- features like HMR, devops and CI/CD support for both web2/web3 for automation.


## Credits to the projects: 

- [web3-monorepo](https://github.com/sebpalluel/web3-monorepo): the initial template based on nx + nest build and package management system, destined to be the single fullstack application workflow needed to start building your scalable Dapps. thanks [Seb palluel](https://github.com/sebpalluel) for sharing this template and much needed feedback.


- [Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io): This correponds to mapping all of the projects in the vertical of cloud computing and their statistics.

## About the team. 

The initiative is started by [Dhruv Malik](Github:@dhruvmalik007) having passion in doing research across the verticals in the web3 space in terms of application architect and as smart contract developer. feel free to reachout in case you want to contribute to open source and are interested in this ambitious project of creating the futureproof template for designing scalable applications.
